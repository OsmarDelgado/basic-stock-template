This is a basic stock template where you can:
- Create a supply with its brand, unit measure, what type it is and add a category

Use Sequilize as ORM and this can connect with a postgres db

## Installation

- Clone the repository and run ```npm install```
- After that run ```npm run dev``` for run the development server
